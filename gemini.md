This repository contains the code for a game written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The premise of the game is a shoot-em-up style top down shooter like touhou, but multiplayer using websockets.

When implementing anything that gets sent over a websocket, make sure you are optimizing for bandwidth to the best of your ability.

Make the code and functions you create human-readable, favoring ease of understanding over clever complexity. Complexity is only justified for performance gain or where the nature of the problem demands it.

Build things modularly where appropriate, moving values into constants rather than hard coding them. Think things like TICK_RATE, BULLET_SPEED, PLAYER_SPEED.
